# Solid-Dry-and-Wet-Waste-segregation-bin
This is a project that I have made in my first year of College. It was a fun learning.

## Working 
We have assembled all the components like IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, Soil 
Moisture sensor with Arduino and did code. We have set intially that the 
wet waste will be segregated in right component of bin and the dry waste will be 
segregated on the left component of the bin. When the waste will be segregated, 
the LCD screen will show whether it is dry or wet waste. The servo motor will 
turn about the angle 60 to 120 to segregate. We are using IR sensor in this project
to detect the object. The soil moisture sensor will be used to detect the presence 
of moisture of the waste. We have adjusted multiple values of the moisture sensor 
in every environment. The Ultrasonic sensor will be used to tell how much the 
bin is full and will send the message to the LCD screen.
