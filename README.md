## 🎯Problem Statement 
Solid waste segregation is the process of separating different types of waste 
materials, such as paper, plastic, metal, organic matter, and other types of waste, 
into separate bins or containers for collection and disposal. This process is 
important for several reasons, including improving the efficiency of waste 
collection and transportation, and reducing the volume of waste sent to landfills. 
However, manual segregation of waste can be time-consuming and labor intensive and due to this sometimes people segregate waste incorrectly which results in problems like global warming and recycling.
In this work, we describe a solid waste segregation system using Arduino that is designed to automatically sort dry and 
wet waste materials. The system includes sensors and other input devices to 
identify the type of waste, and control mechanisms to sort the waste into the 
appropriate bin or container. Overall, our system demonstrates the potential of 
Arduino and other microcontrollers to automate the process of solid waste 
segregation, improving efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of 
waste disposal.

## ⚒Working 
We have assembled all the components like IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, Soil 
Moisture sensor with Arduino and did code. We have set intially that the 
wet waste will be segregated in right component of bin and the dry waste will be 
segregated on the left component of the bin. When the waste will be segregated, 
the LCD screen will show whether it is dry or wet waste. The servo motor will 
turn about the angle 60 to 120 to segregate. We are using IR sensor in this project
to detect the object. The soil moisture sensor will be used to detect the presence 
of moisture of the waste. We have adjusted multiple values of the moisture sensor 
in every environment. The Ultrasonic sensor will be used to tell how much the 
bin is full and will send the message to the LCD screen.
